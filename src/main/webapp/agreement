 <p>We seriously remind internet users that you should have a correct awareness of the cyberspace, it is important that you use caution and avoid potential problems so you can safely enjoy being online.</p>
 <p>Teens generally have less life experience and strong curiosity, so may be more likely to be hooked by virtual world in the cyberspace and easily be cheated or used by some people with bad intentions. Parents and teachers should talk with the teens about what they can and cannot do online, try to understand their needs, interests, and curiosity, work with them to help avoid problems in cyberspace. Teens should know that who you meet online are not who they say they are. Never go to the meeting by yourself, you might put yourself in danger by meeting them even if you think you know the person and trust them.</p></div><div class="content"></div></div></div>
